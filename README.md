[I apologize ahead of time if some of the characters are different as I went with what was shown as an example of on Wikipedia] 

### Minecraft Java ver: 1.16.5
### Forge ver: 36.2.0

## Contents:
* 48 Hiragana blocks
* 8 Frames
* 2 Crafting Tables



## Lifecycle
This pack was designed for 1.16.5.  If it is requested for a different version that MCreator has a plugin for, I will attempt to convert it for that version as well. Unknown if I will add blocks for Katakana or Kanji.

## Getting Started


### Crafting
1. Hiragana: Start by placing a vanilla crafting table inside the 3x3 crafting table grid, and receive 1 new Hiragana crafting table with 48 output slots.
2. Frames: Start by placing a Hiragana crafting table inside the 3x3 crafting table grid, and receive 1 new Frame crafting table with 8.

### Note:
1. I know there are functional marks, diacritics, diagraphs etc.. but without knowing exactly which ones use which yet, they will have to wait until a possible update.
